# OpenGL-SuperBible5
Source code to the OpenGL SuperBible 5 book. It's kind of silly how the authors chose to target Windows when OpenGL is supposed to be cross-platform. This repo will focus on only Linux since many of the presented programs don't work or even compile. 

To build all the programs, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/UC-Labs/OpenGL-SuperBible5.git
cd OpenGL-SuperBible5
cmake --preset sb5
cmake --build --preset sb5
```
